# Audio DNN Classification
Deep Neural Network topologies for audio classification. This repo includes a variety of topologies, including:  
Dense, Dense-LSTM,  
1D-CNN, 1D-CNN-LSTM,  
2D-CNN, 2D-CNN-LSTM  

The implementations are powered by Python.

Specific implementations are described in the following papers:  
"1D & 2D CNNs vs Temporal Aggregated Feature-Based Methodologies for Audio Classification"  
"Continuous Speech Emotion Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks"  

You can experiment using the LVLib or BDLib Datasets:
