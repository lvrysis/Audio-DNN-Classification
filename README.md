# Audio DNN Classification
Deep Neural Network topologies for audio classification. This repo includes a variety of topologies, including:  
Dense, Dense-LSTM,  
1D-CNN, 1D-CNN-LSTM,  
2D-CNN, 2D-CNN-LSTM  

The implementations are powered by Python.

Specific implementations are described in the following papers:
